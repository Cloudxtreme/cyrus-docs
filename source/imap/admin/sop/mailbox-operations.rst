Mailbox Operations
==================

Determining the size of a mailbox
---------------------------------

The size of a mailbox can be obtained using the cyradm utility, by issuing the :ref:`"info"<cyradm_info>` command.

When using quota, the size of a mailbox hierarchy under the quota root folder can be obtained using the :ref:`"listquotaroot"<cyradm_listquotaroot>` command.
