Cyrus IMAP 3.0.0 Release Notes
==============================

.. WARNING::

    Cyrus IMAP 3.0 is under active development, and subject to change.

    Do **NOT** use this version unless you're a developer of sorts.

*   Dropped support for Berkeley DB.

*   The handling of configure options has changed, dropping support for
    ``-with-cyrus-prefix`` and ``--with-service-path``.

    The binary blobs to be executed outside of the
    :manpage:`cyrus-master(8)` service process are now in ``--bindir``
    or ``--sbindir``, and the binary blobs to be executed by :manpage:`cyrus-master(8)`
    are in ``--libexecdir``.
