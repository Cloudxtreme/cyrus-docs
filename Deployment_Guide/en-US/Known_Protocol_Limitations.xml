        <title>POP3 and Mailbox Locking</title>
        <para>
            POP3, as described in <ulink url="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1939.txt">RFC 1939</ulink>, requires a mailbox to be locked by a POP3 session.
        </para>
        <para>
            As such, when POP3 is used simultaneously across multiple clients, and a common set of mailboxes, an error similar to the following would occur;

            <para>
                The Cyrus IMAP POP3 server implementation does not have the aforementioned problem of POP3 sessions locking mailboxes. As of version 2.4.0, Cyrus IMAP allows multiple POP3 sessions to operate on a single mailbox by providing a &ndash;virtual&ndash; snapshot of the mailbox, and all operations are executed to this snapshot. A safety mechanism ensures no messages are deleted until after all existing operations have closed the mailbox &ndash;including IMAP, LMTP and POP.
