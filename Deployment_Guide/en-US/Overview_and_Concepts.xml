        This chapter gives an overview of several aspects of the Cyrus IMAP server, as they relate to deployment.

        <para>
            The Cyrus IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) server provides access to personal mail and system-wide bulletin boards through the IMAP protocol. The Cyrus IMAP server is a scalable enterprise mail system designed for use from small to large enterprise environments using standards-based technologies.
        </para>
        <para>
            A full Cyrus IMAP implementation allows a seamless mail and bulletin board environment to be set up across one or more nodes. It differs from other IMAP server implementations in that it is run on <emphasis>sealed nodes</emphasis>, where users are not normally permitted to log in. The mailbox database is stored in parts of the filesystem that are private to the Cyrus IMAP system. All user access to mail is through software using the IMAP, IMAPS, POP3, POP3S, or KPOP protocols.
        </para>
        <para>
            The private mailbox database design gives the Cyrus IMAP server large advantages in efficiency, scalability, and administratability. Multiple concurrent read/write connections to the same mailbox are permitted. The server supports access control lists on mailboxes and storage quotas on mailbox hierarchies.

    <section id="sect-Deployment_Guide-Overview_and_Concepts-Mailbox_Namespace">
        <title>Mailbox Namespace</title>
        <para>
            By default, the Cyrus IMAP server presents mailboxes using the <code>netnews</code> namespace convention. This means mailbox names are case-sensitive. A mailbox name may not start or end with a &#34;<code>.</code>&#34; character, nor may it contain two &#34;<code>.</code>&#34; characters in a row.
        </para>
        <para>
            When implemented using the default <code>netnews</code> namespace convention, non-ASCII characters and shell meta-characters are not permitted in mailbox names. Optionally, the server can present mailboxes using the UNIX hierarchy convention &mdash;see <xref linkend="sect-Deployment_Guide-Mailbox_Namespace-Alternate_Namespace" /> for more information.
        </para>

            <title>Standard (Internal) Namespace</title>
            <para>
                All personal mailboxes for user &#34;<code>bovik</code>&#34; begin with the string &#34;<code>user.bovik.</code>&#34;. For example, if user &#34;<code>bovik</code>&#34; had a personal &#34;<code>work</code>&#34; mailbox, it would be called &#34;<code>user.bovik.work</code>&#34;. To user &#34;<code>bovik</code>&#34;, however, the prefix &#34;<code>user.bovik.</code>&#34; normally appears as &#34;<code>INBOX.</code>&#34;. The mailbox &#34;<code>user.bovik.work</code>&#34; would therefore appear as &#34;<code>INBOX.work</code>&#34;. If the access control list of the mailbox permitted other users to see that mailbox, it would appear to them as &#34;<code>user.bovik.work</code>&#34;.
            </para>
            <para>
                The mailbox &#34;<code>user.bovik</code>&#34; is where the user &#34;<code>bovik</code>&#34; normally receives new mail, and normally appears to user &#34;<code>bovik</code>&#34; as &#34;<code>INBOX</code>&#34;. The mailbox &#34;<code>user.bovik</code>&#34; is referred to in this document as user &#34;<code>bovik</code>&#34;&#39;s <code>INBOX</code>.
            </para>
            <para>
                Administrators create and delete users by creating and deleting the users&#39; <code>INBOX</code>. If a user has an <code>INBOX</code>, then they are allowed to subscribe to mailboxes. Only users without dots in their userid are permitted to have an <code>INBOX</code>. (A user with a dot in their userid would be able to login but would not be able to receive mail. Note that when using the unix hierarchy seperator, this is not the case, and any user may have a dot in their userid.)
            </para>
            <para>
                When an administrator deletes a user&#39;s <code>INBOX</code>, all of the user&#39;s personal mailboxes are deleted as well.
            </para>
            <para>
                With the one notable exception of <code>INBOX</code>, all mailbox names are system-wide &mdash;they refer to the same mailbox regardless of the user. Access control lists determine which users can access or see which mailboxes. Using

            <para>
                In contexts which permit relative mailbox names, the mailbox namespace works as follows:

                            Names that do not start with &#34;.&#34; are fully qualified.

                            Names that start with &#34;.&#34; are relative to the current context.

                Thus, if you are working with folder names and the top of the hierarchy is named &#34;<code>cmu.</code>&#34;, the name &#34;<code>comp.infosystems.www</code>&#34; resolves to &#34;<code>comp.infosystems.www</code>&#34; and the name &#34;<code>.comp.infosystems.www</code>&#34; resolves to &#34;<code>cmu.comp.infosystems.www</code>&#34;.

            <title>Alternate Namespace</title>
            <para>
                The Cyrus IMAP server can also use analternate namespace which allows a user&#39;s personal mailboxes to appear as if they reside at the same level as that user&#39;s <code>INBOX</code> as opposed to children of it. With this feature, it may appear that there are non-unique names for mailboxes between users (2 different users may each have a top level &#34;work&#34; mailbox), but the internal representation is still <code>user.name.work</code>.

        <title>Access Control Lists</title>
        <para>
            Access to each mailbox is controlled by each mailbox&#39;s access control list. Access Control Lists (ACLs) provide a powerful mechanism for specifying the users or groups of users who have permission to access the mailboxes.
        </para>
        <para>
            An ACL is a list of zero or more entries. Each entry has an identifier and a set of rights. The identifier specifies the user or group of users for which the entry applies. The set of rights is one or more letters or digits, each letter or digit conferring a particular privilege.

            <para>
                In the Unix authorization mechanism, identifiers are either a valid userid or the string &#34;<code>group</code>&#34;: followed by a group listed in <filename>/etc/group</filename>. Thus:
            </para>
            <para>

<screen>    root&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refers to the user root
    group:staff&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refers to the group staff</screen>

            </para>
            <para>
                It is also possible to use unix groups with users authenticated through a non-/etc/passwd backend. Note that using unix groups in this way (without associated <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> entries) is not recommended.
            </para>
            <remark> Actually, what Cyrus requires is the getgrent(3) POSIX sysctl. As such, NSS needs to be configured to have the groups available, one of which includes &#34;files&#34;, but could also include &#34;ldap&#34;. </remark>
            <para>
                Using the Kerberos authorization mechanism, identifiers are of the form:
            </para>
            <para>

<screen><emphasis>$principal</emphasis>.<emphasis>$instance</emphasis>@<emphasis>$realm</emphasis></screen>

            </para>
            <para>
                If <literal>$instance</literal> is omitted, it defaults to the null string. If <literal>$realm</literal> is omitted, it defaults to the local realm.
            </para>
            <para>
                The file <filename>/etc/krb.equiv</filename> contains mappings between Kerberos principals. The file contains zero or more lines, each containing two fields. Any identity matching the first field of a line is changed to the second identity during canonicalization. For example, a line in <filename>/etc/krb.equiv</filename> of:
            </para>
            <para>

<screen>bovik@REMOTE.COM bovik</screen>

            </para>
            <para>
                will cause the identity <literal>bovik@REMOTE.COM</literal> to be treated as if it were the local identity <literal>bovik</literal>.
            </para>
            <para>
                A site may wish to write their own authorization mechanism, perhaps to implement a local group mechanism. If it does so (by implementing an <code>auth_[whatever]</code> PTS module), it will dictate its own form and meaning of identifiers.

                Mail delivery is a special case. In order for a message to be delivered to a mailbox, the quota root for the mailbox must not have usage that is over the limit. If the usage is not over the limit, then one message may be delivered regardless of its size. This puts the mailbox&#39;s usage over the quota, causing a user to be informed of the problem and permitting them to correct it. If delivery were not permitted in this case, the user would have no practical way of knowing that there was mail that could not be delivered.

    <!--
<h2><a name="notification">New Mail Notification</a></h2>

The Cyrus IMAP server comes with a notification daemon which
supports multiple mechanisms for notifying users of new mail.
Notifications can be configured to be sent upon normal delivery
(<code>"MAIL"</code> class) and/or sent as requested by a <a
href=specs.php#sieve>Sieve</a> script (<code>"SIEVE"</code> class).

By default, both types of notifications are disabled.
Notifications are enabled by using one or both of the following
configuration options:

<ul>
<li>
the "<code>mailnotifier</code>" option selects the <a
href=man/notifyd.8.php>notifyd</a> method to use for
"<code>MAIL</code>" class notifications
</li>

<li>
the "<code>sievenotifier</code>" option selects the <a
href=man/notifyd.8.php>notifyd</a> method to use for
"<code>SIEVE</code>" class notifications (when no method is specified by
the Sieve action)
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="partitions">Partitions</a></h2>

Partitions allow administrators to store different mailboxes in
different parts of the Unix filesystem.  This is intended to be used
to allow hierarchies of mailboxes to be spread across multiple disks.

<h3><a name="partitionscreate">Specifying Partitions with "<code>create</code>"</a></h3>

When an administrator creates a new mailbox, the name of the partition
for the mailbox may be specified using an optional second argument to
the "<code>create</code>" command.  Non-administrators are not permitted to
specify the partition of a mailbox.  If the partition is not
specified, then the mailbox inherits the partition of its most
immediate parent mailbox.  If the mailbox has no parent, it gets the
partition specified in the "<code>defaultpartition</code>" configuration
option.

<P>The optional second argument to the "<code>create</code>" command can
usually be given only when using a specialized Cyrus-aware administrative
client such as <I>cyradm</I>.

<h3><a name="partitionsrename">Changing Partitions with "<code>rename</code>"</a></h3>

An administrator may change the partition of a mailbox by using the
rename command with an optional third argument.  When a third argument
to rename is given, the first and second arguments can be the
same &mdash;this changes the partition of a mailbox without changing its
name.  If a third argument to rename is not given and the first
argument is not "<code>INBOX</code>", the partition of a mailbox does not change.
If a third argument to rename is not given and the first argument is
"<code>INBOX</code>", the newly created mailbox gets the same partition it would
get from the "<code>create</code>" command.

<h2><A NAME="news">News</a></h2>

Cyrus has the ability to export Usenet via IMAP and/or export shared
IMAP mailboxes via an NNTP server which is included with Cyrus.  For
more information on exporting news groups through the IMAP server, see
<a href="install-netnews.php">install-netnews.php</a>.

<h2><a name="pop3">POP3 Server</a></h2>

The Cyrus IMAP server software comes with a compatibility POP3 server.
Due to limitations in the POP3 protocol, the server can only access a
user's <code>INBOX</code> and only one instance of a POP3 server may exist for any
one user at any time.  While a POP3 server has a user's <code>INBOX</code> open,
expunge operations from any concurrent IMAP session will fail.

When Kerberos login authentication is being used, the POP3 server
uses the server identity
"<code>pop.<VAR>host</VAR>@<VAR>realm</VAR></code>" instead of
"<code>imap.<VAR>host</VAR>@<VAR>realm</VAR></code>", where
"<code><VAR>host</VAR></code>" is the first component of the server's host
name and "<code><VAR>realm</VAR></code>" is the server's Kerberos realm.
When the POP3 server is invoked with the "<code>-k</code>" switch, the
server exports MIT's KPOP protocol instead of generic POP3.

<h3><a name="syslog">The <code>syslog</code> facility</a></h3>

The Cyrus IMAP server software sends log messages to the "<code>local6</code>"
syslog facility.  The severity levels used are:

<UL>
<LI><code>CRIT</code> - Critical errors which probably require prompt administrator action
<LI><code>ERR</code> - I/O errors, including failure to update quota usage.
The syslog message includes the specific file and Unix error.
<LI><code>WARNING</code> - Protection mechanism failures, client inactivity
timeouts
<LI><code>NOTICE</code> - Authentications, both successful and unsuccessful
<LI><code>INFO</code> - Mailbox openings, duplicate delivery suppression
</UL>

<h2><a name="recovery">Mail Directory Recovery</a></h2>

This section describes the various databases used by the Cyrus IMAP
server software and what can be done to recover from various
inconsistencies in these databases.

<h3><a name="recoverymboxdir">Reconstructing Mailbox Directories</a></h3>

The largest database is the mailbox directories.  Each
mailbox directory contains the following files:

<DL>
<DT>message files
<DD> There is one file per message, containing the
   message in RFC 822 format.  Lines in the message are separated by
   CRLF, not just LF.  The file name of each message is the message's
   UID followed by a dot (.).

<P>In netnews newsgroups, the message files instead follow the

The "<code>reconstruct</code>" program can be used to recover from
corruption in mailbox directories.  If "<code>reconstruct</code>" can find
existing header and index files, it attempts to preserve any data in
them that is not derivable from the message files themselves.  The
state "<code>reconstruct</code>" attempts to preserve includes the flag
names, flag state, and internal date.  "<code>Reconstruct</code>"
derives all other information from the message files.

An administrator may recover from a damaged disk by restoring message
files from a backup and then running reconstruct to regenerate what it
can of the other files.

The "<code>reconstruct</code>" program does not adjust the quota usage
recorded in any quota root files.  After running reconstruct, it is
advisable to run "<code>quota -f</code>" (described below) in order to fix
the quota root files.

<h3><a name="recoverymbox">Reconstructing the Mailboxes File</a></h3>

<B><I> NOTE: CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE </I></B>

The mailboxes file in the configuration directory is the most critical
file in the entire Cyrus IMAP system.  It contains a sorted list of
each mailbox on the server, along with the mailboxes quota root and
ACL.

To reconstruct a corrupted mailboxes file, run the "<code>reconstruct
-m</code>" command.  The "<code>reconstruct</code>" program, when invoked
with the "<code>-m</code>" switch, scavenges and corrects whatever data it
can find in the existing mailboxes file.  It then scans all partitions
listed in the imapd.conf file for additional mailbox directories to
put in the mailboxes file.

<p>The <code>cyrus.header</code> file in each mailbox directory stores a
redundant copy of the mailbox ACL, to be used as a backup when
rebuilding the mailboxes file.

<h3><a name="recoveryquotas">Reconstructing Quota Roots</a></h3>

The subdirectory "<code>quota</code>" of the configuration directory (specified in
the "<code>configdirectory</code>" configuration option) contains one file per
quota root, with the file name being the name of the quota root.  These
files store the quota usage and limits of each of the quota roots.

<p>The "<code>quota</code>" program, when invoked with the "<code>-f</code>"
switch, recalculates the quota root of each mailbox and the quota
usage of each <a href="#quotaroots">quota root</a>.

<h4><a name="recoveryquotasrm">Removing Quota Roots</a></h4>

To remove a quota root, remove the quota root's file.  Then run
"<code>quota -f</code>" to make the quota files consistent again.

<h3><a name="recoverysubs">Subscriptions</a></h3>

The subdirectory "<code>user</code>" of the configuration directory contains user
subscriptions.  There is one file per user, with a filename of the
userid followed by "<code>.sub</code>".  Each file contains a sorted list of
subscribed mailboxes.

<p>There is no program to recover from damaged subscription files.  A
site may recover from lost subscription files by restoring from backups.

<h2><a name="configdir">Configuration Directory</a></h2>

Many objects in the configuration directory are discussed in
the Database Recovery section. This section documents two
other directories that reside in the configuration directory.

<h3><a name="configdirlog">"<code>log</code>" Directory</a></h3>

The subdirectory "<code>log</code>" under the configuration directory permits
administrators to keep protocol telemetry logs on a per-user basis.

<p>If a subdirectory of "<code>log</code>" exists with the same name as a user, the
IMAP and POP3 servers will keep a telemetry log of protocol sessions
authenticating as that user.  The telemetry log is stored in the
subdirectory with a filename of the server process-id and starts with
the first command following authentication.

<h3><a name="configdirproc">"<code>proc</code>" Directory</a></h3>

The subdirectory "<code>proc</code>" under the configuration directory
contains one file per active server process.  The file name is the ASCII
representation of the process id and the file contains the following
tab-separated fields:

<UL>
<LI>hostname of the client
<LI>login name of the user, if logged in
<LI>selected mailbox, if a mailbox is selected
</UL>

The file may contain arbitrary characters after the first newline
character.

<p>The "<code>proc</code>" subdirectory is normally be cleaned out on
server reboot.

<h2>Message Delivery</h2><a name="messagedelivery"></a>

<p>Mail transport agents such as Sendmail, Postfix, or Exim communicate
with the Cyrus server via LMTP (the Local Mail Transport Protocol)
implemented by the LMTP daemon.  This can be done either directly by the
MTA (prefered, for performance reasons) or via the <code>deliver</code> LMTP
client.

<h3>Local Mail Transfer Protocol</h3><a name="lmtp"></a>

<p>LMTP, the Local Mail Transfer Protocol, is a variant of SMTP design for
transferring mail to the final message store.  LMTP allows MTAs to deliver
"local" mail over a network.  This is an easy optimization so that the
IMAP server doesn't need to maintain a queue of messages or run an
MTA.</p>

<p>The Cyrus server implements LMTP via the <code>lmtpd</code> daemon.  LMTP
can either be used over a network via TCP or local via a UNIX domain
socket. There are security differnces between these two alternatives; read
more below</p>

<p>For final delivery via LMTP over a TCP socket, it is necessary to use
LMTP AUTH.  This is accomplished using SASL to authenticate the delivering
user.  If your mail server is performing delivery via LMTP AUTH (that is,
using a SASL mechanism), you will want their authentication id to be an
LMTP admins (either via the <code>admins</code> imapd.conf option or via the
<code>&lt;service&gt;_admins</code> option, typically <code>lmtp_admins</code>).</p>

<p>Alternatively you may deliver via LMTP to a unix domain socket, and the
connection will be preauthenticated as an administrative user (and access
control is accomplished by controlling access to the socket).</p>

<p>Note that if a user has a sieve script, the sieve script runs authorized
as *that* user, and the rights of the posting user are ignored for the purposes
of determining the outcome of the sieve script.</p>

<h3>Single Instance Store</h3><a name="singleinstance"></a>

<p>If a delivery attempt mentions several recipients (only possible if
the MTA is speaking LMTP to <code>lmtpd</code>), the server attempts to
store as few copies of a message as possible.  It will store one copy
of the message per partition, and create hard links for all other
recipients of the message.</p>

<p>Single instance store can be turned off by using the
"singleinstancestore" flag in the configuration file.</p>

<h3>Duplicate Delivery Suppression</h3><a name="duplicate"></a>

A message is considered a duplicate if two copies of a message with
the same message-id and the same envelope receipient are received.
Cyrus uses the duplicate delivery database to hold this information,
and it looks approximately 3 days back in the default install.

<p>Duplicate delivery suppression can be turned off by using the
"duplicatesuppression" flag in the configuration file.</p>

<h3>Sieve, a Mail Filtering Language</h3><a name="sieve"></a>

Sieve is a mail filtering language that can filter mail into an appropriate
IMAP mailbox as it is delivered via lmtp.  For more information, look
<A HREF="sieve.php">here</a>.

<h3>Cyrus Murder, the IMAP Aggregator</h3><a name="aggregator"></a>

Cyrus now supports the distribution of mailboxes across a number of IMAP
servers to allow for horizontal scalability.  For information on setting
up this configuration, see <A href="install-murder.php">here</A>.
